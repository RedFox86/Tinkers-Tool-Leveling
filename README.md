This is a remake of the original Tinker's Tool Leveling made for 1.12.2.

**WARNING**: This mod removes all semblance of balance on Tinker's Construct. The whole mod is based upon the limited amount of modifiers, and this mod removes that.

That being said, this mod grants your tool a random modifier upon leveling up. Each successive level requires more and more experience, which can be gained throughout different methods for each tool.

**CUSTOMIZATION**

Customization is supported via datapack to modify the tags used in this mod to determine valid items to gain exp. You can modify the tags to change which blocks or entities are excluded from giving exp. Additionally, to change the amount of exp gotten, there is a config file in (instance)/config/tinkersleveling-common.toml.

**FEATURES**

*   Support for most Tinker's tools and armor.
*   Adds a random modifier to your tool each levelup.
*   Each levelup requires 2.5x the exp than the previous one.
*   At the moment just upgrades (no abilities) can be gotten.

You are allowed to use this mod in your modpack :P

**MODIFIER WORKTABLE***
The modifier worktable is a recently added part of Tinker's Construct that allows you to remove modifiers from a tool and get the upgrade back. While this does disrupt the point of the entire mod (random upgrade that you have no control over), there is nothing I can do to stop this other than completely removing the modifier worktable altogether. I encourage you not to remove the level-granted modifiers, but it's entirely up to you.

**FAQ**

"Where is the config??"

\- Config can be accessed by creating a datapack for your world to override the tags of the mod.

"Fabric pls!!"

\- While I do appreciate fabric, as there is not anÂ __official__ Tinker's Construct port for fabric, I will not create a fabric version.
