This is a remake of the original Tinker's Tool Leveling made for 1.12.2.

**WARNING**: This mod removes all semblence of balance on Tinker's Construct. The whole mod is based upon the limited amount of modifiers, and this mod removes that.

That being said, this mod grants your tool a random modifier upon leveling up. Each successive level requires more and more experience, which can be gained throughout different methods for each tool.

**CUSTOMIZATION**

At the present, you can customize this mod by disabling / modifying certain entities and blocks by how much experience they give. You can modify this through datapacks by overriding the tags within the mod. In the future, more customization might be avalible, such as including custom modifiers within the levelup pool, but at the moment this is all that exists.
