This is a remake of the original Tinker's Tool Leveling made for 1.12.2.

**WARNING**: This mod removes all semblance of balance on Tinker's Construct. The whole mod is based upon the limited amount of modifiers, and this mod removes that.

That being said, this mod grants your tool a random modifier upon leveling up. Each successive level requires more and more experience, which can be gained throughout different methods for each tool.

**CUSTOMIZATION**

At the present, you can customize this mod by disabling / modifying certain entities and blocks by how much experience they give. You can modify this through datapacks by overriding the tags within the mod. In the future, more customization might be available, such as including custom modifiers within the levelup pool, but at the moment this is all that exists.

**FEATURES**

*   Support for most Tinker's tools and armor.
*   Adds a random modifier to your tool each levelup.
*   Each levelup requires 2.5x the exp than the previous one.
*   At the moment just upgrades (no abilities) can be gotten.

You are allowed to use this mod in your modpack :P

**FAQ**

"Where is the config??"

\- Config can be accessed by creating a datapack for your world to override the tags of the mod.

"Fabric pls!!"

\- While I do appreciate fabric, as there is not anÂ __official__ Tinker's Construct port for fabric, I will not create a fabric version.
